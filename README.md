# java-learning-POO
How I learned OOP with Java. // 19/01/2023
Course taken: https://youtu.be/KlIL63MeyMY (Curso em Video)

Every day, I studied the concepts and then practiced. As a result,
now I can program anything better, and it sure helps me
programming anything. All projects are independent of each other.

There were classes purely theoretical, such as History of OOP, good ways to type a
class and among others. Here, however, I focused on practice.

Every project is in Portuguese-BR, so will be a bit hard to get everything without
a translation, but nothing that compromises "entertainment".
-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------

The following is the learning order:

1- Classes - Objects
2- Access Modifiers
3- Special Methods 
4- Exercise
5- Encapsulation 
6- Class relationships 
7- Exercise 2 
8- Inheritance
9- Inheritance 2 (No access modifiers)
10- Polymorphism (override - runtime) 
11- Polymorphism (overload - compile time)
12- Challenge

Note: usually the main class is identified by <aulaX>.

-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------

1- Classes - Objects

The first lesson is very basic. It consists of simulating that Caneta (pen) is a class, and
then instantiate it, use all its methods and attributes in the most
simple as possible.



2- Access modifiers

I continued with the previous example, but this time
using public, private, and protected modifiers.



3- Special Methods

I used the getters, setter, toString, and constructor methods.



4- Exercise

I made a more robust practice, and better designed. In this one, I create a "system"
banking, where I can create an account for anyone and then open an account,
close account, deposit...


5- Encapsulation

I simulated that a ControleRemoto (remote control) was a class, and then applied it using
the concepts of encapsulation (Interface). Getters and setters methods can
stay private: it won't make a difference.



6- Class relationships

I imagined an emoji arena, where each one fight each other (in a very
simple system). For that, I created a relationship class (Luta [Fight]), and then I did the fight
(where Java takes a random number out of 3, and depending on the number, the
algorithm determine the winner/loser.



7- Exercise 2

I simulated the relationship between a Pessoa (person) and a Livro (book), and the book has an interface.



8- Inheritance

The most important concept of OOP could not be less than the others; this because
it was quite a complete practice. For this, I simulated that a school has 4 classes
to work: Pessoa (Person), Aluno (student), Professor(teacher) and Funcion√°rio (employee), where the last three inherited
all the characteristics of the first.



9- Inheritance 2 (No-Access Modifiers)

I implemented the Abstract and Final modifiers in a fully practical example. 
In addition, I studied the third one from the outside: static.



10- Polymorphism (Override - runtime)

The most complete implementation of all practices; this is the longest practice
of my learning, since Overlapping Polymorphism is essential for
any programmer.
I used 11 classes: Animal, Mamifero (Mammal), Ave (Bird), Reptil (Reptile), Peixe (Fish), Canguru (Kangaroo), Cachorro (Dog),
Arara (Macaw, but let's translate to "Parrot") , Tartaruga (Turtle), Cobra and GoldFish, making the logical inheritance between them, according to
contemporary biology.



11- Polymorphism (Overload - compile Time)

Overload polymorphism is a less common concept than the previous one, but indispensable
for any programmer. The class that implements all these concepts, here, is
Cachorro (Dog), where contains all overload polymorphisms.



12- Challenge

Finally, a challenge that integrates everything I've learned so far. I imagined the concept of Video
and Gafanhoto (spectator), and then I put it all into practice. Video has interface; Spectator
Interact with Video...
